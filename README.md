## Data
### Types of Data
There are many different types of data that get presented to users in finance apps. In my research, the main types that are displayed include transaction history, account balances, budget breakdowns, and investment portfolios.
- Transaction History: A list of purchases and transaction made into the users account
- Account Balances: Shows the user how much money are in each of his accounts
- Budget Breakdown: Categorizes how the user is spending money, usualy in a visual format like a graph
- Investments: Displays users holdings, performance and trends of investments
### How Data is Presented
- Graphs: Graphs are used to display information in a visual format to help breakdown spending, track expenses vs income, sales, etc.
- Clean design so that users arent overwhelmed by all the information being displayed

## Common Actions
- Viewing account balances
- Check recent transactions
- Sending money to others
- Paying bills
- Automatic bill payments
- Mobile check deposits
- Buying and selling stocks
- Categorizing and tracking expenses
- Credit score monitoring
- Locking credit/debit cards
- Branch locator
- Tax Services

## Transaction Types
- Peer-to-Peer transfers: Sending money to someone you know (normally have information saved in a contact within app)
- Account Transfers: Transfering money between the different accounts that user has access to
- Bill payments (credit cards, utilities, rent/mortgage)
- Investment transactions
- Deposits/Withdrawls
- Credit card transactions
- Tax payments

## UI Paradigms
- Home Page Overview: Provides a snapshot of the users finances and displays information the user is most likely to view
- Tab Based Navigation: Information is seperated into tabs so the user can easily navigate and find what they are looking for
- Graphs and Charts: Used to display information in an easy to understand format. Pie charts to display finance breakdowns, bar graphs for account tracking over long periods of time
- Quick Action Buttons: Buttons that are front and center for actions the user will use most frequently like money transfers and bill payments
- Color Coding: Used to help users differentiate between categories, accounts, etc

## Hierarchy/Structure
- Most frequently used features should be front and center
- These include transactions, bill paying, account balances

## UI/UX Conventions I Plan on Using
- Pie chart to breakdown user spending and the catgories
- Tab Bar for navigation - makes the app layout easy to follow for all different types of users
- Home page with account outlines (simple cards with account name and current balance)
- Quick access buttons for sending money, account transfers, paying bills, and check depositing
- A detailed page for each account with recent transactions and some quick access buttons for transfers, bills, and deposits
- An investments page where the user can view stock information, can quickly buy and sell stock via quick access buttons

## Existing Conventions/Common Patterns
- Color themes: Most finance apps use a professional color patern consisting of blue, green and grays. These colors often convey proffesionalism and are typicaly easy to read and look at for long periods of time
- Graphs and Charts: In most finance apps, graphs and charts are used to visually represent budget breakdowns, investment performance, and are used to help the user understand their finances in an easy to follow manner
- Tab Navigation: Tabs at the bottom or top of the screen are commonly used for navigation, providing quick access to different sections like accounts, transactions, and investments
- Quick Access Buttons: Normally found at the top of the screen, these buttons are used for the most common user actions such as sending money, account transfers, paying bills, and depositing money

## Uncommon/Non-Existent Conventions
- Game Elements: Most finance apps dont have game elements incorporated into them like saving streaks, or badges for limiting spending. These arent seen often due to the fact that most finance apps are for professionals and this may be seen as childish and unprofesional
- Collaborative Financial Planning: Most finance apps dont have a collaborative planning option. This is mostly due to security reasons, if one users account got breached, the rest of their families financial information could be at risk
- Customizable accounts: Most financial apps dont allow you to customize your account with custom profile pictures and themes. This is due to the fact that these apps arent meant for social use, and personilization may be seen as less professional

## User Personas
- Typically targeted towards adults and elderly, but are becoming more comon with teenagers.
- A simple to follow layout is crucial for finance apps due to the fact that people of all age groups will be using them. If the app is too hard to follow, you are limiting the amount of people who will want to use it, especially with the elderly.
- Some appealing features for financial apps could include: responsive customer support, educational resources/financial tips, a clear guide to the app on initial startup

## Clearly Displaying Data
- Clear Summary of Data: The home page of the app should have a good, easy to read overview of the users banking information. It should include account balances, investment summaries and some quick access buttons in a simple fashion
- Transaction lists: When a user is looking at one of their accounts, they should see a list of recent transaction they made. These should include the amount and what business it was spent at.
- Graphs and Charts: Users should have access to graphs whether they are pie charts or bar graphs to view breakdowns of spending or investment tracking. They should be easy to read and understand.
- Color Coding: Color coding can be used to break down transactions, account types, or make information easily distiguishable.

## Data Collection
- Sending Transfer: When we need to collect information for sending money, we can use a form to allow the user to enter the information of the recipient. It can include the persons name, amount being sent, and the user phone number/email. Most money transfer also require a security question and answer/password. Finally, there is normally an optional message field where the sender can write a small paragraph containing information about the transfer.
- Recieving Transfer: When recieving money, you are usually greeted with a form that gives you the security question that the sender provided. It also should have a drop down menu that allows the user to select which account they would like to deposit the money into.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, keeping the app simple and organized is the key to success when it comes ot finance apps. Some obstacles I may face when building my finance app include creating the pie charts and graphs. This is something I have never experimented with but I am excited to. I think the design of the shpaes and breaking the piechart into sections will prove to be difficult. I plan on focusing on the home page, trying to make it organized and make sure the user sees any important information straight away.
